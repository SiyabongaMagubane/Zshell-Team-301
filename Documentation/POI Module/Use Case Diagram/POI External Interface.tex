\subsection{GUI:}
	The application should make use of a GUI that is incredibly user friendly, such that guests that come to the university will be able to navigate through the application with ease.
\subsection{Screen layout:}
	The layout of the application is important and there should be a clear flow when using it. Screen resolution should also be considered because some of the phones that may use the application may not have a high enough resolution for the application to work.
