\section{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Recovery time:}
	System takes round about a minute to recover from a system failure.System should restart in the event of system failure saving all POI information changes to the database and clearing all volatile events that were  not submitted to the database.
\subsection{Response time:}
	System responds to queries in the least time possible almost instantaneously in real-time  to make the system bearable to use.
\subsection{Shutdown time:}
	System takes less than 5 seconds to shutdown, successfully aborting all running tasks on the system;shutting down all database connection and then closing the system without damaging any information on the database and web-server connections.Loading 			progress bar should be displayed if it exceeds the time.
\subsection{Start-up time:}
	System takes less then 10 seconds to establish connection to database and web-server
	Loading progress bar should be displayed if it exceeds the time.
\subsection{Throughput:}
	System at optimum performance uses about 30 percent of the systems RAM.Depending on the processing power of the system multi-processing increases speed in multi-threading, multi-processing unit.
