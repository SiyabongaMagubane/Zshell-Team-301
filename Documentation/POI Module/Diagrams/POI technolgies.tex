\subsection{Database Layer:}
	The database layer will make use of JDBC. JDBC provides a familiar java interface which enables easier use of SQL, which is advantagous as other layers will be generating SQL queries.
\subsection{Persistance Layer:}
	The application will use Java Persistance API(JPA) in order to manage and access data.
	Java will be used in order to save locations and to get the current locations for android devices.
	Objective C will be used instead for IOS devices.
\subsection{Presentation Layer:}
