	\section{Architecture Requirements}
		\subsection{Design Constraints}
These Requirements outline what navUP should be able designed according to the client.
		 
		 \subsubsection{Modularity}
		Each activiity of the system is done by exactly one module. 

		\subsection{Minimal Dependency}
		The use of dependency injection to make sure modules are as loosely coupled as possible, In a layered architecture. Making sure layers are also loosely coupled.
		\subsection{Well Defined Input}
		Every input/output is needed for the function of that specific module.
		
		\subsection{Abstraction}
		Make sure changes later wont affect the application as a whole, by abstracting the implementation details.
